Motivation for this practice is that i want to showcase the use of a Framework and NPM packages
The use of custom styling rules to customize a framework
The use of custom styles through ways of overriding the framework
The use of custom styles using a SCSS style-sheet
The different ways to interact with components and ways to structure
The use of TypeScript syntax as well as semantic HTML and ES6 (both jsx and tsx)
